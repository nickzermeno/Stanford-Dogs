# Stanford Dogs
This project contains code and resources for working with the Stanford Dogs dataset. The dataset contains over 20,000 annotated images of 120 dog breeds, with bounding boxes and object masks.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the code in this project, you will need:

Python 3.6 or higher
TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV
Pillow
## Installation
To install the required packages, run:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Downloading the dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from the official website.

After downloading the dataset, extract the contents of the archive into a directory called data in the root of the project.

## Running the code
The code for working with the dataset is contained in the Jupyter notebook main.ipynb. To open the notebook, run:

Copy code
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
From there, you can run each cell in the notebook to perform various tasks, such as:

Loading the dataset
Preprocessing the images
Training a convolutional neural network
Evaluating the model on a test set
