# Stanford Dogs

This is a computer vision project that aims to classify dog breeds using the Stanford Dogs dataset. The project is built using Python and various computer vision libraries, such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine and install the required libraries.

### Prerequisites

The following are the prerequisites to run this project:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Stanford Dogs dataset, which contains over 20,000 images of 120 dog breeds. The dataset is available for download on the [Stanford Dogs website](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).

The dataset can be found in the `Datasets` directory.

## Computer Vision Models

Various computer vision models were used to classify the dog breeds. The models used are:

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Transfer Learning using VGG16

The models were trained and tested using the `main.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

## Results

The results of the computer vision models are presented in the `StanfordDogsReport.pdf` report.
